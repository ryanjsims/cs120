### summer\_email\_script.py

To use the emailing script, you need to add your username and secondary CatMail password to the script. To get your secondary CatMail password, which *is not* your netid password, go to https://it.arizona.edu/documentation/catmail-configuration-settings-imap and follow the instructions under the section titled "Your secondary (CatMail) password." You may already have a secondary password, to check, simply search your inbox for an email with the subject "Your secondary, CatMail password"
